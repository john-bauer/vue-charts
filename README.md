# ðŸ“ˆ Vue Charts

## About
Vue Charts is a project that showcases what you can do with Vue and Chart.js, tied together by [the vue-chartjs](https://vue-chartjs.org/) package.

## Goals
When I began working with Vue, I was looking for a charting library with a wide range of options, smooth animations, and simple implementations. I had worked with [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) a few years ago, and once I found [this repository](https://github.com/apertureless/vue-chartjs) I was sold.

The goal of this project is to show developers a live, working demo of vue-chartjs in action. Hopefully it can make someone else's work a little bit easier.

It will include:
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, doughnut, pie, polar area, radar, bubble)
- Charting with local data.
- Charting with API data.
- Charting with reactive props.

## Live Demo
